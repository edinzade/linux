Linux Bond / Team Multiple Network Interfaces (NIC) Into a Single Interface



Bonding is nothing but Linux kernel feature that allows to aggregate multiple like interfaces (such as eth0, eth1) into a single virtual link such as bond0.


Linux allows binding of multiple network interfaces into a single channel/NIC using special kernel module called bonding.

Step #1: Create a Bond0 Configuration File


vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0

DEVICE=bond0
IPADDR=192.168.1.20
NETWORK=192.168.1.0
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
USERCTL=no
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes

Step #2: Modify eth0 and eth1 config files



Open both configuration using a text editor such as vi/vim, and make sure file read as follows for eth0 interface


Modify/append directive as follows:
DEVICE=eth0
USERCTL=no
ONBOOT=yes
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
BOOTPROTO=none

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1


DEVICE=eth1
USERCTL=no
ONBOOT=yes
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
BOOTPROTO=none



Step # 3: Load bond driver/module



Make sure bonding module is loaded when the channel-bonding interface (bond0) is brought up. You need to modify kernel modules configuration file:


vi /etc/modprobe.conf


Append following two lines:

alias bond0 bonding
options bond0 mode=balance-alb miimon=100

Step # 4: Test configuration


First, load the bonding module, enter:
# modprobe bonding



Restart the networking service in order to bring up bond0 interface, enter:
# service network restart


Make sure everything is working. Type the following cat command to query the current status of Linux kernel bonding driver, enter:
# cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0


To list all network interfaces, enter:
# ifconfig
